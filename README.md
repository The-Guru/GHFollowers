This is the "take home" project from Sean Allen's [iOS Dev Job Interview Practice - Take Home Project course](https://seanallen.teachable.com/courses/)
In which you create a take home project that you usually have to do in an iOS job interview.

Some interesting topics you will learn in this course:
* Programmatic UI
* Custom controls
* Networking
* Persistence
* Code readability

Some screenshots of the project:

I can't recommend enough taking this course if you want to speed up your iOS developing skills!
